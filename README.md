# Problematic

Interviewing is hard. You want to get to know people and bring out the best in
them, but you only just met and in 60 minutes you have to be done.

One of the things we test for in SPT is problem solving. As engineers, solving
problems is what we do, and so we want to get an idea of what it would be like
to do that together.

We've been going about this by presenting our candidates with problems that
we've faced and challenge them to solve it with us. The only problem is that
we've already solved it, and probably in a better way than any one person could
in just 60 minutes.

One consequence of this is that it's hard to have an even-keeled discussion and
really work the problem together, and another is that it can feel like the goal
of the interview is just to solve the problem.

_Problematic_ is an attempt to manage this and level the playing field by
dispensing greenfield problems that neither the interviewer nor the candidate
has solved before so they can really get an idea of what it's like to work
together.
